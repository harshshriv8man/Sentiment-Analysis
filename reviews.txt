1. These headphones are amazing. The sound quality is crisp, and the noise cancellation works like magic. I’ve never had a better listening experience during flights!

2. Honestly, I expected more for the price. The sound is fine, but the build feels cheap and the Bluetooth keeps disconnecting randomly.

3. Solid performance overall. Battery life is impressive, and they're very comfortable for long sessions. I just wish the touch controls were more intuitive.

4. Disappointed. The noise cancellation is underwhelming, and there's a constant hissing sound. Customer support didn’t help either.

5. Absolutely love them! Great for work calls and music. The sleek design is a bonus, and they pair instantly with my devices.
