I was a bit underwhelmed by my visit to The Cozy Spoon. While the interior decor is cozy as advertised, the flavors of the dishes didnâ€™t quite meet my expectations. My chicken marsala lacked the depth of flavor I was hoping for, and the side vegetables were somewhat overcooked. On the bright side, the dessert selection was impressive, and the vanilla panna cotta was a lovely way to finish the meal. The staff were friendly, but the overall experience felt average.
