I recently visited The Cozy Spoon with a group of friends, and I must say, the atmosphere was incredibly warm and inviting. The staff greeted us with genuine smiles, and the service throughout the evening was attentive without being intrusive. I ordered the grilled salmon, which was cooked perfectly â€” tender and flavorful, paired with a delightful lemon butter sauce. The dessert menu also impressed me; the chocolate lava cake was rich and decadent. Overall, a fantastic dining experience that I would happily recommend.
