The Cozy Spoon offers a charming ambiance that makes it perfect for both casual meals and special occasions. However, during my last visit, the wait time was longer than expected, which dampened the experience a bit. Despite that, the food did not disappoint. The mushroom risotto was creamy and packed with flavor, though I wished the portion was a little bigger. I also appreciated their extensive wine list, which complemented the meal nicely.
