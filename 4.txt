Dining at The Cozy Spoon was a delightful experience. From the moment we arrived, the team made us feel welcome and comfortable. I particularly loved the homemade bread served with herb butter — a small touch that made a big difference. The standout dish for me was the beef short ribs, which were fall-off-the-bone tender and seasoned to perfection. The portions were generous, and the prices were fair considering the quality. I’ll definitely be returning soon.
