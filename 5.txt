I had high hopes for The Cozy Spoon based on the reviews, but unfortunately, my experience was mixed. The ambiance and decor lived up to the cozy vibe, and the service was polite. However, my pasta was slightly undercooked, and the sauce was bland. On a positive note, the salad was fresh and vibrant, and the homemade lemonade was refreshing on a hot day. It felt like the kitchen was having an off day, so Iâ€™m willing to give it another try in the future.
